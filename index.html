    section containers with paragraphs, allowing the CSS to create further margins and responsiveness.  -->

      <p>The main photo features our newest family member, and I've chosen this image because it encapsulates the most important part of my life; being a proud father.</p>

      <p>As a father of four children, my 35 years have provided a diverse range of experiences, from happy memories to hard learned lessons, which have fostered a positive and focused mindset. 
        By appreciating that the future offers an abundance of opportunities, I've made a commitment to the programmer journey. </p>

      <p>My interest in programming is driven from an enjoyment in solving puzzles, and a desire to refine abstract solutions that can address real-life problems.
         By taking the approach that all projects have significance, and that there is a duty to provide genuine attention and value for every client, the role of 
         a programmer becomes meaningful and impactful. 
      </p>

      <p>This view has motivated the significant commitment to complete two accredited courses, and cement some solid foundations in a new career as a developer. 
        While still in the early stages, the excitement felt learning new techniques that can move ideas from the mind, and put them squarely on 
        the screen, has been very encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>With a Diploma of Information Technology and a Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security forming the groundwork for a junior role, I look forward to progressively 
        acquir the skills and experiences that will lead to more senior responsibilities.

    finally settled on a flat, shadowed and centered within available whitespace option. This brought it back to the design That
    I was trying to achieve. Something elegant and sleek, while allowing a little character to jump through, but avoid the clutter
    that many effects (rotations/slides) etc were bringing to my design. I found this to be difficult to achieve, and chased it 
    for quite a while, before bringing it back to a simple yet, hopefully, more elegant design. It incorporates CSS for colours,
    shading, position, and contains multiple paragraphs, with a button for the link to a mock-up resume file.  -->
