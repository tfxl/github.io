    section containers with paragraphs, allowing the CSS to create further margins and responsiveness.  -->

      <p>My interest in programming is driven from a desire to solve problems, in the abstract and the real world, particularly when they overlap.

      <p>One of my interests in information technology is the creation of products that not only meet the expectation of the client, but also find ways to add value that was not realised prior. Every project has meaning to me, which is an essential requirement to be fully involved.</p>

    that many effects (rotations/slides) etc were bringing to my design. I found this to be difficult to achieve, and chased it 
    for quite a while, before bringing it back to a simple yet, hopefully, more elegant design. It incorporates CSS for colours,
    shading, position, and contains multiple paragraphs, with a button for the link to a mock-up resume file.  -->
