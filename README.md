The purpose of this website is to communicate graphical and coding ability to a prospective employer. It will demonstrate a visual awareness, a recognition of appropriate design, and learnt coding skills.  
  
It may also be able to provide some insight into the type of person you are. 
  
The features of this webpage currently convey a visual aesthetic, with the use of black & white, and greyscale picture to generate a down-to-earth feel. The accents of red create some liveliness and offer a visual pathway through the webpage. It allows text heavy input as desired.  
  
This features sections that can be navigated via the navigation, presented as part of the intial page view. As the size of the webpage conforms to tablet and phone viewports, a new slimline header appears that allows future features to be integrated, namely a drop down "hamburger" menu and also a link to a contact page, which can be developed beyond this project.

Our target audience is a prospective employer, but it should also capture the interest of a particular type of employer. In this case, a group that appreciates the connection of family, and the interest in a newly trained person in their 30's. The responsibility of raising a family might be considered an applicable characteristic of the role that is being sought.  

Tech Stack used has been html, css and git. Github, Balsamiq, Powerpoint have also been utilised.
