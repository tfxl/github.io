The purpose of this website is to communicate coding ability and design capabilites to a prospective employer, and also offer an insight into potential work output. It will help to demonstrate an awareness of function and features, including creating a visual impact.

This website can also provide some insight into the type of person I am, through photos and text. It may assist building an overall picture of skills and what is important in my life.

The features of this webpage help build a visual aesthetic, with the use of black & white, and greyscale picture to generate a down-to-earth feel. The accents of red create some liveliness and offer a visual pathway through the webpage. It allows text heavy input as desired while still retaining the visual impacts.

The webpage is crafted into sections that can be accessed via scrolling or through the navigation, which is noticed immediately on desktop, and found only a short way below the main display on phones. A future menu can be incorporated into the design for tablet and phones. With this in mind, as the webpage dimensions respond to tablet and phone viewports, a new slimline header appears that allows integration of future features, namely the drop down "hamburger" menu and also a link to a contact page, which can be developed beyond this project.

Remembering that target audience is a prospective employer, the website is tailored to also 'speak' to a particular type of employer; namely those that appreciate the connection and balance of family values with workplace dedication. It also conveys the obvious value of one having responsibility for a family, coupled with a mature age mindset, that allows additional role prospects within their organisation.

Tech Stack to create this website are html and css. Further use of git, Github, Balsamiq and Powerpoint. All photos are owned by the author.

Wireframes, sitemap and screen shots of the website in design and devlopment can be found in the following .pdf file:
